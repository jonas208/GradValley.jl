# struct SequentialContainer
@doc raw"""
    SequentialContainer(layer_stack::Vector{<: Any})

A sequential container (recommended method for building models). A SequetialContainer can take a vector of layers or other containers (submodules).
While forward-pass, the given inputs are *sequentially* propagated through every layer (or submodule) and the output will be returned.
The execution order during forward pass is of course the same as the order in the vector containing the layers or submodules.

!!! note
    You can use a SequentialContainer in a GraphContainer (and vice versa).
    You can also use a SequentialContainer in a SequentialContainer (nesting allowed).

# Arguments
- `layer_stack::Vector{<: Any}`: the vector containing the layers (or submodules, so other containers), the order of the modules in the vector corresponds to the execution order

# Indexing and Iteration 
The sequential container is indexable and iterable. Indexing one element/iterating behaves like indexing one element of/iterating over 
the `sequential_container.layer_stack` passed to the container at initialization. However, if the index is a range (UnitRange{<: Integer}), 
a new SequentialContainer containing all the requested submodules/layers is initialized and returned. 
`length(sequential_container)` and `size(sequential_container)` both just return the number of modules in the layers vector (equivalent to `length(sequential_container.layer_stack)`).

# Examples
```julia-repl
# a simple chain of fully connected layers
julia> m = SequentialContainer([Fc(1000, 500), Fc(500, 250), Fc(250, 125)])
# computing the output of the module (with random inputs)
julia> input = rand(Float32, 1000, 32)
julia> output = forward(m, input)

# a more complicated example with with nested submodules
julia> feature_extractor_part_1 = SequentialContainer([Conv(1, 6, (5, 5), activation_function="relu"), AvgPool((2, 2))])
julia> feature_extractor_part_2 = SequentialContainer([Conv(6, 16, (5, 5), activation_function="relu"), AvgPool((2, 2))])

# computing the output of the module (with random inputs)

julia> m[end] # returns the softmax layer (Softmax)
julia> m[begin:end-1] # returns the entire model except the softmax layer (a new SequentialContainer is initialized and returned) 

# if a SequentialContainer contains BatchNorm layers (regardless of whether they are nested somewhere in a submodule or not), 
# the mode of all these layers at once can be switched as follows
julia> trainmode!(m)
julia> testmode!(m)

"""
    backward(sc::SequentialContainer, derivative_loss::Union{AbstractArray{T, N}, Real}) where {T, N}

The backward function for computing the gradients for a SequentialContainer (highly recommend for model building). The function takes the container (so mostly the whole model)
as the first argument and the derivative of the loss as the second argument. No gradients are returned, they are just saved in the layers the container contains.

!!! warning
    Calling `backward` multiple times can have serious consequences. Gradients are added (accumulated) by convention, so calling `backward` multiple times after the corresponding `forward` call,
    the gradients of the weights AND the returned gradient w.r.t. the input are added up (accumulated)! 
    So even the gradient returned by the `backward` call doesn't stay the same when calling `backward` multiple times after the `forward` call.
    Note that the gradients of the weights can be reset by [`zero_gradients`](@ref) but the gradient w.r.t. to the input of a container cannot be reset (except of course by another `forward` call).

julia> output = forward(m, rand(Float32, 1000, 32))
# use a loss function (with random data as target values) and save the derivative of the loss
julia> loss, derivative_loss = mse_loss(output, rand(Float32, 125, 32)) # note that GradValley.Optimization.mse_loss must be imported
# before the gradients are recalculated, the old gradients should always be reset first

    GraphContainer(forward_pass::Function, layer_stack::Vector{<: Any})

A computational graph container (recommended method for building models). A GraphContainer can take a function representing the forward pass of a model
and a vector of layers or other containers (submodules).
While forward-pass, a tracked version of the given inputs are passed through the given forward pass function and the output will be returned.
During forward pass, the computational graph is build by a function overload based automatic differentiation system (AD). During backward pass, this computational graph 
is used to compute the gradients.

!!! note
    You can use a GraphContainer in a SequentialContainer (and vice versa).
    You can also use a GraphContainer in a GraphContainer (nesting allowed).

!!! warning
    Note that the GraphContainer is an experimental feature. The behavior of this module could change dramatically in the future.
    Using this module can may cause problems.

# Arguments
- `forward_pass::Function`: the function representing the forward pass of a model
- `layer_stack::Vector{<: Any}`: the vector containing the layers (or submodules, so other Containers), the order doesn't matter

# Guidelines
GradValley has its own little, rudimentary function overload based automatic differentiation system based on [ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl).
It was designed to allow simple modifications of a normal sequential signal flow, which is the basis of most neural networks. 
For example, to be able to implement ResNet's residual connections. So it represents an alternative to data flow layers known from other Deep Learning packages.
In a way, it is similar to the forward function known from every [PyTorch model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/buildmodel_tutorial.html#define-the-class).
Since the AD does not offer that much functionality at this point in time, the following guidelines must be observed:
- The forward pass function must take at least two arguments. The first is the vector containing the layers (which was passed to GraphContainer at initialization). The following arguments (the last could also be a Vararg argument) are the data inputs.
- The forward pass function must be written generically enough to accept arrays of type T<:AbstractArray or numbers of type T<:Real as input (starting with the second argument).
- Array inputs that are being differentiated cannot be mutated.
- The initialization of new arrays (for example with `zeros` or `rand`) and their use in mix with the inputs passed to the forward function is not allowed.
- Avoid dot syntax in most cases, there only exist a few differentiation rules for the most basic vectorized operators (.+, .-, .*, ./, .^).
